## Introduction

In the world of Cyber Intelligence, monitoring specific keywords that on the Internet is very important. Just like in time of war you need to understand what are the thing that other country or enemny is talking about and 

## Overview

If you ever read the OPSEC, here is the article that I always refer to: [OPERATIONS SECURITY - 2017](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/28/2002524943/-1/-1/0/NTTP-3-13.3M-MCTP-3-32B-OPSEC-2017.PDF) by the US Marine Corp. A significant portion (80%) of unclassified information has the potential to provide clues or context related to the classified information (20%).

-> To excel in Cyber Intelligence and OSINT, the collection phase of the Intelligence Cycle is crucial. This phase necessitates the systematic collection and monitoring of specific keywords within the cyberspace.

## Study Case & Benefit of Keyword Monitoring (Surveillance)

### Tracking Threat Actor 

Threat actor like to talk, brag and sometimes public their work, because that how human nature work, if you read [The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Human-Nature-Robert-Greene/dp/0525428143) -> They have a fundamental need for recognition and admiration

We be able to track and monitor them by first anlyzing their malware, their keyword that they mention on social media or any type of platoform that we could get our hand on (Darknet, Clearnet whatever the case)

We track:

- Github Monitoring / Tracking
- Telegram Monitoring / Tracking
- Social Medida Tracking (Facebook, Thread, )
- Darknet (Breachforum, )
- Game Hacking / Hacking Forum 


### OSINT Investigation

We collect a huge data pool which we can arrchive and turn it into historical data, which will be use in other operation / investigation if needed


### Control Over The World (Just kidding)

By the time you collect all the information (probably you won't) and analyze all of their data, I think you and I probably turn into Skynet or something and ready to take over the world
