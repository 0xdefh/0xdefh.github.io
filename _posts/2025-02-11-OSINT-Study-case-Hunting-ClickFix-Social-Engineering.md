## Overview

I'm pretty late on this one tbh.

From reading a bunch of TI reports & news related to phishing & social engineering, there is somewhat new phishing technique in 2024 - 2025, which is ClickFix. I've done a blog post about Telegram Impersonate or you could
say [How to find impersonate website](https://0xdefh.github.io/posts/OSINT-TTP-How-to-find-impersonate-website/).

In that blog, I show how to track or find a impersonate website using pivoting from various thing from the legit website & and some HTML content, javascript, and UIL.
