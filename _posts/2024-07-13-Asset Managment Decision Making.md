## Introduction

When I start and learn about Cyber Security in general, while reading NIST and how to create a better defend plan for a company, I realize you can't win a battle against threat actor if you don't know and understand what are you protecting.

In NIST, the first step a of Cyber Security program that is IDENTIFY. The assets managment seem like a easy task but it is not trust me, it is not something you can plug a tool and then it magically map out all your assets and show you what are the most critical assets (high value) in your envinronment. It not just technology but it's depend on the people the culture and the platfrom you are using (Cloud, Hybrid, On-prems).

`IT asset management (ITAM) is foundational to an effective cybersecurity strategy and is prominently featured in the SANS Critical Security Controls and NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity `

`"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle." - Sun Tzu, The Art of War"`

## Overview

In the IDENTIFY of the NIST we'll plit it into stages:
- Plan for asset management
- Identify the services 
- Identify the assets
- Document the assets
- Manage the assets

Note: A service is a set of activities that the organization carries out in the performance of a duty or in the production of a product.

## Plan for asset managment

First step is to prepare all the necessary documents that support the Asset Managment process and getting the approval from the upper managment in order to determined the scope of the assets management.
