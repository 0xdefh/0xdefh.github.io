## My name is Zeroska

What's in a name? Whether you call me Zeroska or something else, what really matters is that you've found your way here. I'm glad you're here, and I hope you'll find something useful on this page

My work in cybersecurity keeps me on the cutting edge of technology, while my passion lies in exploring the big questions of life through philosophy. I'm also fascinated by intelligence and business, both on a practical and theoretical level.

## The Inspiration Behind My Writing

Looking back to my student days, I wouldn't have discovered all those incredibly helpful blogs brimming with cultural insights and ideas if it wasn't for complete strangers. While some content wasn't perfect, it offered a fresh perspective that broadened my horizons. The knowledge shared by these online communities truly made a difference during my college years. I'm incredibly grateful for their contributions.

Inspired by their generosity, I decided to create this page. It's my way of sharing the valuable knowledge and interesting things I've collected over time. I believe everyone has something to offer, and this platform allows others to share their thoughts and experiences as well.
